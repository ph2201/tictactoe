So this repository previously contained my todolist app WITHOUT the local backend server, and I was evaluated for that version for the previous assignment (not this one), and I had a few questions about it as it was not made clear in Canvas why I was deducted some points. Although since there is no way to prove that the only modification I made for the integration with the backend server was the addition of the backend directory and the changes from using AsyncStorage to local backend using Axios, I am fine with not having my previous assignment regraded, but I would still greatly appreciate if you could take a look at my components and App.js to see what would have been the reasons for my point deductions at that time. (The commit history disappeared because I force-pushed and overwrote the repository, a foolish deed, indeed. Also, the link I submitted to this repository on Canvas may not work any more because I renamed the repository from 'tictactoe' to 'todolistapp', which I failed to do when I was submitting for the previous assignment because I did not know I could rename a repository once it had been created; I instead simply mentioned the misleading repository name in the README file at that time, which, of course, has been deleted permanently now.)

In summary, although this is my submission for the assignment "Integrating your to do list app with a local backend node.js server", I would also appreciate if you could give me some feedback on why I got an A- for the assignment "To do list app: Async Storage and extras" based on the code here (which, of course, automatically exempts from regrading eligibility as their is no proof that I did not make any changes except those necessary to integrate with a local backend serverâ€”it is purely for the sake of my curiosity and future references that I would like to know how I could have done a better job).

Thank you!
